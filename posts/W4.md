## High Compressibility

    const iframe = document.getElementById (`W4I01`)
    iframe.width = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16

## Low Compressibility

Generative art is created (in part or entirely) using algorithms or mathematical formulas, where decisions about the artwork’s features are made by an autonomous system. Philip Galanter’s insight is useful for the purposes of creating generative art as it is a reminder that structure isn’t always necessary in this process and resisting this notion could yield much more meaningful results. Utilising mistakes and failures in generative art, rather than fixing them, can produce interesting and unexpected pieces that wouldn’t exist in the confines of structure. 

The third example created on p5.js is based on a phyllotaxis, which is the regular arrangement of leaves or flowers around a plant stem (at approximately 137.5 degrees). This structure depicts high effective complexity due to the difficulty in predicting the possible outcome / behaviour. This structure is formed from the recursive function (n++;), which generates a self-referential pattern by updating the value of n on each iteration of the draw() function.

## [Bleuje](https://bleuje.com/randomanimations/)

Etienne Jacob’s (bleuje) work utilises randomness in their animations to give the appearance of unpredictability, which is amplified by the touch interaction that switches from one animation to another. They balance the randomness within constraints (such as the size of the canvas or the range for movements), which keeps the animations visually coherent and engaging without feeling overly chaotic.
