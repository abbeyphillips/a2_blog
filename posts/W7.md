## “Unlike the interesting, the zany really works against its constraints” McKenzie Wark.

The zany disrupts the limitations of its given structure as a means of being unconventional and eccentric. I believe that is the whole point of the zany, as something cannot be abnormal while confining to everyone’s expectations. Perhaps if the zany worked within its constraints, it would no longer even be considered zany. Chaos implies a lack of order, while zany describes something avant-garde and peculiar. However, they both depict a state of being unpredictable, and they are similar in the sense that they are unrestrained by structure. I would definitely say that my AT2 is more chaotic than zany, as it is more serious than playful. I could potentially make it zanier by changing the colours or adding a glitch effect to add some eccentric unconventionality.

Disclosure:
There are significant discrepancies in my spelling of the word ‘mould’ (and ‘mold’) throughout the whole assignment, but it’s too late to change it.

My net art mimics the mesmerising pattern of slime mould with randomised movements that leave behind trails when they relocate. The sketch definitively corresponds to the text ‘What Is It Like to Be A Fungus?’, as it is a visual representation of slime mould, which is not actually fungi but take the form of amoeba and are superficially similar to the sporangia of fungi. I chose the yellow to symbolise the signature slime mould colouring, with a dark blue background to make it pop. My initial interaction applied a repulsion force to the mould particles based on the user’s mouse position, with a random gravity angle to introduce noise, making the mould appear to scatter when in contact with the mouse.

Frankly, I found the particle systems interaction more satisfying than the chosen one, but far less chaotic. The recursive branching effect is visually alike slime mould tendrils or veins, which initiates a small branching structure from each mould’s position when the mouse is in the vicinity. This function makes branching growth sprouts from the mould when triggered, which gives the piece a living, reactive appearance. The frenzied combination of the slime mould’s movements and the recursive branches makes the piece look alive and gives me an eerie, uncomfortable feeling (comparable to the way I felt reading the book ‘Paradise Rot’). 

I accompanied the visuals with a sonic element titled ‘Synthetic Unease’ by colorsCrimsonTears on Freesound. I found it difficult to find audio that was chaotic and complemented the slime mould’s rhythm and aesthetics. This piece was made by slowing down the speed of ‘nature ambiance’, editing the pitch, and mixing it with a recording of an air conditioner, which was the perfect combination of digital and nature. I had some issues playing the audio in the full screen mode of p5.js, which were solved by adding a mouse pressed function that allows users to play and stop the audio by clicking anywhere on the screen. 

The piece is post-digital as it explores the emergent, intelligent behaviour of slime mould through JavaScript code. By merging biological systems with browser-based interactivity, it embodies a post-digital approach - where digital tools serve not as spectacle, but as a means to reflect on the organic, the procedural, and the human-machine interface.


## Variables

Global variables:
molds - array holding all instances of mould

num - total number of moulds to generate (5000)

d - pixel density used for accessing pixel data (pixelDensity())

song – sound object for playing chaos.mp3

Local variables:
draw():

i - loop counter to iterate through moulds

dx, dy - distance components from mould to mouse

distSq - squared distance between mould and mouse (avoids costly sqrt())

angle - angle from mould to mouse, modified by gravity

gravity - random force added to the angle for chaotic behaviour

moldSpeed - random speed factor for mould displacement

drawBranches():

x, y - current branch position

len - length of each recursive branch

angle - direction of branch growth

depth - controls how many recursive levels to draw

newX, newY - coordinates for the end of the current branch segment

## Iteration

for loop - create/update/display moulds
Mold.update() - repeated pixel checking (per mold)

## Functions

preload() - loads sound file
setup() - sets up the sketch
draw() - updates and renders each frame
mousePressed() - handles mouse interaction
drawBranches() - recursively draws visual branches
Mold.update() - updates mould movement based on sensors
Mold.display() - draws the mould
Mold.getSensorPos()	 - calculates sensor positions

## Boolean Logic

this.stop = false; - controls movement
if (key == "s") - stops animation
if (f > l && f > r) - determines mould's directional choice
if (song.isPlaying()) - audio control
if (distSq < 100000 && i % 10 == 0) - trigger mould branching near cursor

## Arrays

Array of objects - stores and updates all Mold instances
Array of numbers - stores RGBA colour data for every pixel

## Classes

Mold - defines the mould objects' behaviour and properties

## Recursion

drawBranches() - draws recursive branches from a given point
